It still remains to be tested whether or not starting predictions from the initial training date or starting at the end of the training range yields more accuracte predictions. For example if training from January, 2015 to December, 2015 and we want to get predictions for January, 2016 to December, 2016, is it better to start predicting from January, 2015 or at the start of the dates we want (January, 2016).
