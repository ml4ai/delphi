    "In this demo we will be showing how a Dynamic Bayes Network can be constructed from the source code for a FORTRAN program. For the purposes of this demo the FORTRAN program was compiled and interpreted into an equivalent program in Python. This program was then parsed into a JSON representation of the statements and functions contained in the program. We have created a new layer that takes this JSON description, discovers all scopes and assignment statements in the JSON description, and builds a DBN where nodes show how information flows through the variables and assignment statements in the program during runtime."

We will be using pygraphviz to create a DOT file description of the DBN we will create from the JSON file. We will use graphviz to display the created graph from the DOT file. We have defined a set of `ScopeNode` objects in our scopes package that will be used to create our rooted tree of scopes when creating our DBN."

Scopes are nested and the breadth of each scope is shown with a colored bounding box. Function scopes are colored in green while loop scopes are shown in blue. Each scope is labeled with the scope specific name as found in the JSON specification. Variables from the program are shown as ellipses contained in their appropriate scopes. Variables are named with the name of the variable in the program and the name of the scope in which the variable was first defined. Actions, such as variable assignment or conditional evaluation, are shown as red rectangles and are labeled similarly to variables.\n",
