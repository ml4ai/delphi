Modeling complex phenomena such as food insecurity requires reasoning over 
multiple levels of abstraction and fully utilizing expert knowledge about multiple
disparate domains, ranging from the environmental to the sociopolitical.

Delphi is a framework for assembling causal, dynamic, probabilistic  models from 
information extracted from two sources:
- *Text*: Delphi utilizes causal relations extracted using machine reading from
   text sources such as UN agency reports, news articles, and technical papers.
- *Software*: Delphi also incorporates functionality to extract abstracted representations
   of scientific models from code that implements them, and convert these into probabilistic models.

For a detailed description of our procedure to convert text to models, see
[this document](http://vision.cs.arizona.edu/adarsh/export/Arizona_Text_to_Model_Procedure.pdf).

For API documentation, see [delphi.readthedocs.io](https://delphi.readthedocs.io).

Delphi is also part of the [AutoMATES](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates/) project.

## Citing

If you use Delphi, please cite the following:

```
@misc{Delphi,
    Author = {Adarsh Pyarelal and Paul Hein and Clayton Morrison},
    Title = {Delphi: A Framework for Assembling Causal Probabilistic Models from Text and Software.},
    doi={10.5281/zenodo.1436915},
}
```


## Installation

Delphi is under active development in an academic, rather than a commercial
setting, so we do not have the resources to test it out on the Windows operating
system, or provide a one-step/one-click setup process.

That being said, this is a Python package, and we use platform-independent path
handling internally within the code using `pathlib`, so *technically*, it should
work fine on Windows machines as well, and we will try to guide you through the
installation process as much as possible. Pull requests for improvements are
always welcome.

The following are the requirements for Delphi:

- Python 3.6 or higher.
  If you have another version of Python already installed and need it for other
  projects, we recommend [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage
  multiple versions of Python.
- [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) - Delphi uses this to
  visualize causal analysis graphs.

The following installation instructions are directed at developers working on
Linux and MacOS operating systems. We assume familiarity with the following:

- The command line/terminal
- Unix commands such as `cd`.
- Environment variables.

Here are the steps for installation.

- Fire up a terminal, navigate to the directory that you would like to install
  Delphi in, then execute the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ml4ai/delphi
    cd delphi
    pip install .
    ```

### Installing Graphviz on MacOS

This can be done using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```
brew install graphviz
```
If you use Homebrew to install graphviz, then you may need to install
pygraphviz by specifying certain paths, as done below.

```bash
brew install --install-option="--include-path=/usr/local/include/" \
               --install-option="--library-path=/usr/local/lib" pygraphviz
```

### Ubuntu installation notes
To install graphviz on Ubuntu, do

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
```

### Environment variables

To parameterize Delphi models correctly, you will need to set the `DELPHI_DB`
environment variable to the path to your local copy of the Delphi SQLite
database, which you can download with:

```
wget http://vision.cs.arizona.edu/adarsh/delphi.db
```

*Optional*:

If you are working on program analysis, you may want to optionally set the
following environment variables as well.
- `DSSAT_REPOSITORY`: This should point to your local
  checkout of the [DSSAT](https://github.com/DSSAT/dssat-csm) repository.
- `ED2_REPOSITORY`: This should point to your local checkout of the [Ecosystem
  Demography Model](https://github.com/EDmodel/ED2) repository.

## Usage

### Jupyter notebook workflow

Please see `notebooks/Delphi-Demo-Notebook.ipynb` for an example analysis
workflow using a Jupyter notebook.

You can also use the [Delphi binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ml4ai/delphi/master)
to try out the Jupyter notebook demo without having to install Delphi locally.

You can see a prerendered HTML version of the notebook 
[here.](http://vision.cs.arizona.edu/adarsh/Delphi-Demo-Notebook.html)


### Command line usage

In the following sections, we will go into more detail on model execution.

### Execute model

To execute the model, do:

```bash
delphi execute
```

This takes as input the files `dressed_CAG.pkl` which contains an AnalysisGraph object,
and `bmi_config.txt`, which looks like this:

```
rainfall,100.0
∂(rainfall)/∂t,1.0
crop yield,100.0
∂(crop yield)/∂t,1.0
```

and creates an output file `output_sequences.csv` (these are the default input
and output filenames, but they can be changed with command line flags), that
looks like this:

```
seq_no,time_slice,rainfall,crop yield
0,0,100.0,100.0
0,1,102.60446042864127,102.27252764173306
0,2,103.68597583717079,103.90533882812889
1,0,100.0,100.0
1,1,102.16123221277232,101.92000855752877
1,2,103.60428897964772,101.7157053024733
```

- `seq_no` specifies the sampled sequence
- `time_slice` denotes the time slice of the sequence
- The labels of the other columns denote the factors in the CAG. By collecting
    values from the same time slice over multiple sequences, one can create a
    histogram for the value of a quantity of interest at a particular time
    point. The spread of this histogram represents the uncertainty in our
    estimate.

To see all the command line options and the help message, do `delphi -h`.
