Modeling complex phenomena such as food insecurity requires reasoning
over multiple levels of abstraction and fully utilizing expert
knowledge about multiple disparate domains, ranging from the
environmental to the sociopolitical.

Delphi is a Python library (3.6+) for assembling causal, dynamic, probabilistic
models from information extracted from two sources:

- *Text*: Delphi utilizes causal relations extracted using machine
  reading from text sources such as UN agency reports, news articles,
  and technical papers.
- *Software*: Delphi also incorporates functionality to extract
  abstracted representations of scientific models from code that
  implements them, and convert these into probabilistic models.

Delphi builds upon [INDRA](https://indra.bio) and [Eidos](https://github.com/clulab/eidos).

For a detailed description of our procedure to convert text to models,
see [this document](http://vision.cs.arizona.edu/adarsh/export/Arizona_Text_to_Model_Procedure.pdf).

Delphi is also part of the
[AutoMATES](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates/) project.
