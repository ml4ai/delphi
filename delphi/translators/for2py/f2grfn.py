"""
This program is for replacement of autoTranslate bash script.
Instead of creating and using each file for next operation
like in autoTranslate bash script, it creates python object
and passes it to the next function. Thus, it works as calling
a multiple functions in a single program. This new f2grfn.py
does not invoke main functions in each program.

In simplicity, it's a single program that integrated the
functionality of test_program_analysis.py and autoTranslate.

Example:
    This script can be executed as below:

        $ python f2grfn -f <fortran_file>

fortran_file: An original input file to a program that is
to be translated to GrFN.
