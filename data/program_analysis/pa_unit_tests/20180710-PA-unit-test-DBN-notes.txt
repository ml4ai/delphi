20180710 - PA unit test DBN thoughts

() In any presentation of PA, start with this distinction:
	() Computation - of procedure, where variables represent computation state
	() Representation - of a system, where variables represent system state

() Should we care about states of variables that don't get "returned" or "saved"?
	Look at how they're used in DSSAT-csm

() Possible conventions:
	() Always assume variable states are worth representing
	() First: identity variable based on name
	() Identity inference
		() automated: when no additional state change
		() NLP hints
		() When change seems small, ask human
