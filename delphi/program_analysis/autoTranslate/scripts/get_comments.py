    File: get_comments.py
    Author: Saumya Debray
    Purpose: Read the Fortran source file specified and return subprogram
            names together with the associated subprogram-level comments.
    Usage:
        Command-line invocation:

            get_comments.py src_file_name

        Programmatic invocation:

            comments = get_comments(src_file_name)

        The returned value is a dictionary that maps each subprogram name to a
        comment dictionary; the comment dictionary maps each of the categories
        'head', 'neck', and 'foot' to a list of comment strings.  If a
        particular subprogram does not have comments for any of these
        categories, the corresponding entries in the comment dictionary are [].

# This code considers only subprogram-level comments, i.e., whole-line comments
# that come:
#     (a) immediately before the subprogram begins (comment type: "head"); or
#     (b) immediately after the subprogram begins (comment type: "neck"); or
#     (c) immediately after the subprogram ends (comment type: "foot").
#
# A subprogram-level comment that occurs between two subprograms F and G will
# be considered to be F's foot-comment and G's head-comment.
#
# The comments extracted from a file are maintained as a dictionary that maps
# each subprogram name to a comment dictionary; the comment dictionary maps
# each of the categories 'head', 'neck' 'foot' to a list of comment strings.
# If a particular subprogram does not have comments for any of these categories,
# that category is mapped to [] by the comment dictionary for that subprogram.
