    "Finally, we evaluate our CAG and transition model by predicting Net Migration given changes in Economic Crisis. The first four variables are self-explanatory, they set the time range of the evaluation. Right now I have it set to evaluate from January, 2012 to January, 2017. Passing None to start_month and end_month ensures that the CAG is parameterized correctly since only 2012 (with no month by month granularity) exists in our current database for \"Net Migration\". After parameterized we treat None (in the case of the months) as month 1 (or January). \n",

For example if we instead wanted to evaluate \"Conflict incidences\", then we would pass a string representing the full name of the Conflict. \n",

So we use the data for \"Claims on other sectors of the domestic economy\" to infer rates of change for Economic Crisis.\n",
